    #### Open questions
    *Explain the concept of a remote repository in Git. 
    Provide an example of a scenario where a remote repository is beneficial*
    **Your answer:**
    `r text_1`  
    **Sample answer:**  
    e.g.: "A remote repository in Git is a version of a project hosted on the internet or a network, allowing collaboration among multiple developers. 
    It acts as a central hub where team members can push and pull changes, ensuring everyone stays synchronized.
    Example Scenario: Imagine a software development team spread across different geographic locations. 
    Each developer has their local copy of the project on their machine. 
    A remote repository on a platform like GitHub serves as a common space where team members can share their changes, coordinate work, and maintain a unified version of the project"

    *Describe the steps involved in cloning a repository from GitHub to your local machine.
    Why is cloning necessary*
    **Your answer:**
    `r text_2`  
    **Sample answer:** 
    e.g.: "Cloning a repository involves creating a local copy of a GitHub repository on your machine. Here are the steps:
    Copy the repository's URL from GitHub.
    Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the clone.
    Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL.
    Why Cloning is Necessary: Cloning is necessary to download all files, commit history, and branches from the GitHub repository to your local machine. 
    It allows you to work with the project locally, make changes, and contribute back to the original repository."

    *Explain the purpose of a README file in a GitHub repository and its significance in a project*
    **Your answer:**
    `r text_3`  
    **Sample answer:** 
    e.g.: " The purpose of a README file in a GitHub repository is to provide essential information and context about the project, helping both contributors and users understand the purpose, functionality, and usage of the software. 
    The README file serves as the entry point and documentation for the project"
