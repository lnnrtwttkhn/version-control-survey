    If you don't have a personal laptop that you can bring to each class, that's no problem.
    It's possible to borrow a laptop from the university, e.g., from the institute's [notebook center](https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/en/service/notebookcenter.html).
    Please get in contact with the course instructor [Dr. Lennart Wittkuhn](mailto:lennart.wittkuhn@uni-hamburg.de).
