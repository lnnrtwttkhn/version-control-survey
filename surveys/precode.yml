    #### Anonymity and data usage
    All answers are recorded and kept anonymous.
    The recording and evaluation of your responses are conducted anonymously in the research group "Cognitive Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Learning & Change" at the University of Hamburg.
    A personal codeword is used (see below) which you create following a specific rule.
    No one else will have access to it except you.
    The data will be used exclusively for research and educational purposes as part of the course  ["Version Control of Code and Data"](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/) at the University of Hamburg.
    If responses are shared as part of the course, they will be aggregated to ensure anonymity is maintained.
    If you want your data to be deleted, send an email with your codeword to [sekretariat-luv.psych@uni-hamburg.de](mailto:sekretariat-luv.psych@uni-hamburg.de).
