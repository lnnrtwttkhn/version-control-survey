    ### Hello!
    Great that you are interested in becoming a member of the new Open Science Intitative at the Psychological Institute of the University of Hamburg.
    We are planning to kick off the initiative with a first meeting in November.
    In advance, we have a few questions for all those who will potentially join.
    Answering the questions will take 3-5 minutes of your time.
