    ### Hello!
    We have distributed this form to you as you may have participated in one of our Open Science Seminars provided by the Open Science Office at the University of Mannheim. We are very interested in getting your feedback about the seminar series and would like to learn what you would like to see next.
    We thank you in advance for your participation in this survey and for your helpful feedback.
    If you have any questions about this feedback survey please feel free to contact me using the details provided below.
    ### Rationale for this feedback survey:
    This feedback will form part of the basis for determining the evaluation of the course and the services it provides (e.g., teaching, funding and Open Science consulting) beyond 2024.
    We will use the feedback you provide in the impact report which we are currently writing for the Open Science Office.
    This impact report will be handed to the research council of the University of Mannheim to review the performance of the Open Science Office.
